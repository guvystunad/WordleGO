# 🌍 WordleGO

### _“Explore the world and the dictionary.”_

## 🧩 Summary

**WordleGO** is a mobile game that fuses the addictive word-solving charm of **Wordle** with the exploration and movement of **Pokémon GO**.  
Players discover and unlock **Wordle-style puzzles** scattered across a real-world map — each location offering a new challenge and a reason to get up and move around.  

Our goal: make word games **limitless**, **active**, and **healthy**.  
No more waiting 24 hours for your next puzzle — but also, no endless scrolling indoors.
